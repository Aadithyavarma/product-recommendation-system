For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensatio...  Disappointed              NaN                  NaN          rebecca       Negative\n",

Apparently before the budget was cut dramatically. Had they stuck with that decision, this film could have been a great deal better. As it is, Tyler Perry is awful as the lead. Every scene with him speaking made me cringe. I knew this movie was a throw away when I read a producer's quote (after switching from Idris to Tyler) that said, \"if you can get Will Smith or Tyler Perry, you do it\"...
